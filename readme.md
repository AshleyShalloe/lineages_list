# Lineages list

## Intro

It's basically [https://cov-lineages.org/lineage_list.html](https://cov-lineages.org/lineage_list.html) but slightly worse.

Major differences are:

* inclusion of an unaliased lineage name column
* not bothering at all with the graphs
* moving the withdrawn lineages to a separate table
* date filter function
* all lineages are included

That, and the fact it isn't updated automatically.

The filter feature is really rather slow and makes the page unresponsive while it is filtering. This is fixable.

## Usage

Run the Jupyter notebook and in theory you'll get an `index.html` file out the other end.
