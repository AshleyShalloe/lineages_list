# Lineages list

## Intro

It's here: [https://ashleyshalloe.github.io/lineages_list/](https://ashleyshalloe.github.io/lineages_list/)!

It's basically [https://cov-lineages.org/lineage_list.html](https://cov-lineages.org/lineage_list.html) but slightly worse.

Major differences are:

* an unaliased lineage name column has been included
* no graphs
* withdrawn lineages have been moved to a separate table
* filter by date function has been added
* all lineages are included
* click table headers to sort

That, and the fact it isn't updated automatically.

## Usage

Run the Jupyter notebook and in theory you'll get an `index.html` file out the other end.
